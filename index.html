                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p1>The Last of Us is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony
                    Computer Entertainment. Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl,
                    Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person
                    perspective. Players use firearms and improvised weapons and can use stealth to defend against
                    hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus. In the online multiplayer
                    mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay.
                </p1>
                <p2>
                    Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game,
                    Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two
                    teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, the other half developed The Last of
                    Us. The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed
                    around it. Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively, through
                    voice and motion capture, and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with the development of the
                    characters and story. The original score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla.

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p1>
                    The Last of Us is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player
                    traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, buildings, forests, and sewers to advance the
                    story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and stealth to defend
                    against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps
                    fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young
                    girl, Ellie, across the United States. The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's
                    winter segment and briefly controls Joel's daughter, Sarah, in the opening sequence.

                    In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and
                    short-range weapons such as a handgun and a short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge
                    limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to
                    distract, stun, or attack enemies. The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected
                    items. Equipment such as health kits, shivs, and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using
                    collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by
                    collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged by finding edible items or through
                    the use of health kits.

                    Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or
                    sneak by them. "Listen Mode" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of
                    hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the
                    dynamic cover system, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during
                    combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the
                    characters. The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie,
                    who is unable to swim, across bodies of water and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas.
                    Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack
                    menu.
